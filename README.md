# LLM Logger

[LLM Logger](https://llmlogger.com) is a tool that helps you keep track of your AI API calls
        
Building an AI product is hard. AIs are unreliable, don't always follow output format, and can behave in surprising and unexpected ways, especially with free-form user input.
        
We help you keep track of how your product is working in the wild and help you improve it.
